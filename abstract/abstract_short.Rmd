% Targeting performance of social cash benefits at multidimensional deprivation in Russian Federation in 2000 - 2011

This paper analyses the targeting performance of monetised in-kind benefits at poor household deprived in terms of income, consumption and material well-being. The social crisis resulted from Russian transition from the socialist system to market economy is far from over. Poverty rates have been falling in 2000s, but a significant proportion of households are still having incomes below the subsistence minimum and the income inequality has been in increase. The socialist welfare state favoured services and in-kind benefits over income transfers. That structure made it weak in terms of poverty reduction and redistributive capacity, but the system wasn't greatly reformed until 2005. Since then the system of in-kind benefits (l'goty) has been dismantled through monetisation of the benefits. These schemes of income transfers covers roughly one fourth of Russian households and have potential to improve the situation. Therefore this paper asks a question to what extend monetisation reform has improved the capacity of Russian welfare state to fulfil its modern tasks of redistribution of income and reduction of poverty? Paper utilises a cross-sectional setting with over-time comparison between rounds 9 to 20 of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Study dataset.
